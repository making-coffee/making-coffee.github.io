## What is Aeropress Brewing? How is it done?

It is a coffee brewing method invented in 2005 by Alan Adler, president of Aerobie. Aeropress's working logic is simply as follows. A pushing force in the range of ten to fifty seconds is applied to the ground coffee beans. This pushing force allows the coffee to brew, with this pushing force the pulp passes through the filter and separates from the liquid. Coffee filters suitable for Aeropress are disc-shaped paper filters.

The purpose of the Aeropress production is to brew coffee worth espresso. However, the resulting coffee reaches a density slightly higher than filter coffee. The Aeropress has four main parts, two cylinders, a filter field and a Filter Cap. One of the cylinders is narrower. It is manufactured to be airtight. This cylinder moves in such a way that air cannot pass through the larger one. Since its discovery, Aeropress has undergone changes in color, material and durability. Although it reached its final form in 2015, it has been produced as BPA-free since 2009. The product, produced with polypropylene starting from February 2015, has a golden yellow design on light gray.

Aeropress is suitable for carrying in a suitcase or backpack with its compact structure. It is suitable for use anywhere from camping to hotel rooms with its lack of electricity and its strong plastic structure. Aeropress;

* If you want to get the best flavors in your coffee, you should use purified water or spring water. Dissolved solids in tap water will adversely affect your coffee flavor.
* You can also increase the quality of your brew noticeably by measuring the amount of coffee with a scale.
* It can be brewed in different variations due to its structure. You can grind your coffee a little more finely and warm the water you use a little more. In this way, you can get completely different results. In addition, your aromatic value can be more concentrated with a metal filter.
* You will know how clean and shiny your coffee brewed with Aeropress is when you pour it into your glass. With the help of the filter, even the finest coffee cannot get into your cup. Thus, you can brew cleaner and brighter coffees from the French Press.

## Brewing Step by Step

You can use a coffee to water ratio of 1:15 for the Aeropress. This tells you that every gram of coffee requires fifteen grams of water. Change this rate according to your wishes. To brew an aeropress for one person, you must use fifteen grams of coffee and two hundred and twenty-five grams of water. The temperature of the water you use should be in the range of 85-90 degrees. If you do not have a water heater with adjustable temperature, you can rest the water for 4-5 minutes to reach the ideal temperature.

Put the filter paper so that it fits snugly to the round filter head. Then place your coffee glass or a coffee pot under it. Get rid of the taste caused by filter paper by pouring the water you have heated on it and make your coffee glass warm.
Pour the finely ground fifteen grams of coffee into the coffee bed. (This measure is about two scales with Aeropress's measuring spoon) Gently shake the appliance to make the coffee grains flat. Make sure it is straight.
Pour 45 ml of water over it. Wait for 25-30 seconds after pouring the water. You can tell that your coffee is starting to appear from the beginning of the bubbles.
At this stage, pour the remaining water slowly and in a circular direction. Be careful not to exceed Level 3 in the Aeropress itself at the stop. Do not wait too long. Using the mixing stick, blend for eight seconds in right, left and up and down motions.
Place the pusher piece on the Aeropress. Then press gently. Take care to press evenly with your hands.
Serve your brewed coffee with your warmed glass. Bon Appetit.
