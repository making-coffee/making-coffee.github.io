Chemex is a 3rd generation coffee brewing method that has been increasing in popularity since the early 2000s. Chemex is similar to drip type coffees in terms of body and taste. However, 20% to 30% thicker filters are used compared to Hario V60 and similar coffee filters. This causes your coffee to brew slower and you will get richer flavors. Although it does not offer an experience as good as the French Press, your coffee will be residue-free and clear.

When brewing coffee with Chemex, the amount is one teaspoon of ground coffee per one hundred and forty grams glass. The grinding process of the coffee should be normal. According to some people, the grinding of coffee should be in the size of the French Press that can be applied. Here you have to set the grinding to stay. If you want your coffee to brew later and have a rich taste, you should grind a little finer. Or if your filter becomes clogged and water passage becomes difficult, you should grind the coffee grains coarser.

It is very important to achieve the ideal ratio while brewing your coffee. You should set the ratio of 1:17, that is, seventeen grams of water per unit of coffee. You can use electronic scales as it will be difficult to adjust. For thirty grams of ground coffee, you should use five hundred and ten grams of water. This ratio is for balancing. You can increase or decrease these rates according to your taste and taste.

## Historical Development of Chemex Brewing

Chemex brew is discovered in 1941 by German Peter Schlumbohm. Peter Schlumbohm is an inventor who makes inventions to make human life easier. He has more than three hundred patents of his own. Sshlumbohm is also a chemist. When he invented Chemex, he wanted it to be not only a coffee brewing apparatus but also a coffee serving apparatus. Thanks to his chemist identity, he had a good command of the mixtures and the necessary parameters. Therefore, he invented double-layer Chemex coffee filters himself. The proof of the success of this product is that it is still exhibited by the Brooklyn Museum Corning Museum of Glass and MOMA (Museum Of Modern Art). In addition, the best design award was given by MOMA in 1943.

## What are the brewing properties?

There are basically three types of brewing tools. It is automatic, with glass handle and wooden one. Chemexler with glass holder consists of 3 Cup (1 Cup 150 ml), 6 Cup, 8 Cup and 10 Cup models. Chemex with wooden handles is available in 3 Cup, 6 Cup, 8 Cup and 13 Cup versions. These two types of brewing are only different in exterior designs. The leather and wooden parts of Chemex with wooden handles are suitable for washing. The technology it contains does not contain chemical residues and you can get the same taste in every coffee you brew. You can brew and heat the glass or wooden model on the stove. Chemex filter papers are 20% to 30% lighter. It does not let the residues and residues you want in your coffee into your coffee. There are four special types of filter paper;

* Pre-folded white round filter fits all models except 3 cups.
* Pre-folded white square filter will fit all models except 3 cups
* Pre-folded straw square filter happens to all models except 3 cup

## How to Brew Coffee with Chemex?

As a first step, heat five hundred and ten grams of water. If you want to heat the glass container and wet the filter, start by heating more water.
Have thirty grams of ground coffee ready. The ground thickness of this coffee may be a little coarser than Drip Over coffee and a little thinner than the French Press.
Place your filter paper in Chemex. Let the three-part side come to the mouth. After placing the filter paper, wet it with hot water. At the same time, heat the jug in which you will put your coffee and pour the water in it.
Make sure your coffee is freshly ground. Pour the coffee in the middle of the filter paper and shake it. This ensures that the coffee is spread evenly.
After the water boils, let it rest for twenty to thirty seconds without pouring it over your coffee. Do not pour all the boiling water at once. Your priority is to get all the coffee wet. After all the coffee is wet, proceed to the Blooming phase. Wait between twenty and thirty seconds. At this stage, carbon dioxide will be emitted. Then you can mix the mixture with the help of a spoon.
Finally, gradually add the remaining water. Do not fill to the brim. At least three cm of space remain. If you think that the water you have added is missing or too much, you can check it with an electronic scale.
As a last step, remove the filter paper. Serve your Chemex coffee.

## Important Points to Consider

If you have any remaining coffee, you can keep it warm by storing it in a thermal jug. Heating the coffee on the fire or with an electric heater can spoil the taste of the coffee. You can also use metal filters instead of paper filters. There is no big difference in terms of taste. You can use it again by cleaning. It is very easy to clean. For wooden models, do not forget to remove the leather apparatus and wood holding apparatus before cleaning. You can also choose to wash it in the dishwasher.

With Chemex, you can maximize your coffee experience. With the electronic scale and kettle, you can achieve ideal proportions and make delicious coffees. There are different models available in the market according to your needs.
